# keycard_application_url_credential (Resource)

Manages URL credentials for a Keycard application. URL credentials locate an application's OAuth client ID metadata, which authenticates the application to the Keycard zone.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# In order for an application to delegate authorization to a zone, it must be
# itself authorized to do so.
#
# Any application which publishes client ID metadata at a publicly available
# location may use keycard_application_url_credential for workload identity.
#
# See https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document-00
# for more details on client ID metadata.
resource "keycard_application_url_credential" "keycard_mcp_gateway_auth" {
  zone_id        = keycard_zone.dev.id
  application_id = keycard_application.public_service.id
  url            = "https://public.example.com/oauth_client"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `application_id` (String) The application this credential belongs to. Changing this will replace the credential.
- `url` (String) The URL credential value. Must be a valid URL. Changing this will replace the credential.
- `zone_id` (String) The zone this credential belongs to. Changing this will replace the credential.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier of the credential.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
# Application URL credentials can be imported using the format: zones/{zone-id}/application-credentials/{credential-id}
import {
  to = keycard_application_url_credential.example
  id = "zones/zone-id-123/application-credentials/credential-id-abc"
}

resource "keycard_application_url_credential" "example" {
  # Configuration will be populated after import
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import keycard_application_url_credential.example zones/{zone-id}/application-credentials/{credential-id}
```
