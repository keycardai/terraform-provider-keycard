# keycard_aws_kms_key_policy (Data Source)

Returns an AWS KMS key policy that grants Keycard permissions to Encrypt and Decrypt operations on the key scoped to this Keycard organization as well as DescribeKey permissions on the key.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Fetch a KMS key policy for customer-managed KMS encryption keys
# This policy can be used when creating AWS KMS keys for Keycard zone encryption
data "keycard_aws_kms_key_policy" "example_policy" {
  # AWS account ID the KMS key belongs to. The root user in the account
  # will be granted access to the key in the policy so you do not lose access
  # to the key when applying this policy verbatim.
  account_id = "123456789012"
}

# Use the policy when creating an AWS KMS key
# This example shows how to integrate with the AWS provider
resource "aws_kms_key" "example_key" {
  description = "KMS key for Keycard zone encryption"
  policy      = data.keycard_aws_kms_key_policy.example_policy.policy
}

# Create a zone using the key that was just created
resource "keycard_zone" "example_zone" {
  name        = "My Zone"
  description = "Zone with data encrypted using customer managed KMS key"

  encryption_key {
    aws {
      arn = aws_kms_key.example_key.arn
    }
  }
}

# Example: Combining the Keycard policy with additional custom policies
# This is useful when you need to grant additional permissions beyond what
# Keycard requires, such as allowing other AWS services or principals to use the key

# Define additional custom policy statements
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "additional_kms_permissions" {
  statement {
    sid    = "AllowCloudWatchLogs"
    effect = "Allow"

    principals {
      type        = "Service"
      identifiers = ["logs.amazonaws.com"]
    }

    actions = [
      "kms:Encrypt",
      "kms:Decrypt",
      "kms:ReEncrypt*",
      "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
      "kms:CreateGrant",
      "kms:DescribeKey"
    ]

    resources = ["*"]

    condition {
      test     = "ArnLike"
      variable = "kms:EncryptionContext:aws:logs:arn"
      values   = ["arn:aws:logs:*:123456789012:log-group:*"]
    }
  }
}

# Combine the Keycard policy with your additional policies
# The source_policy_documents attribute merges multiple policy documents
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "combined_kms_policy" {
  source_policy_documents = [
    data.keycard_aws_kms_key_policy.example_policy.policy,
    data.aws_iam_policy_document.additional_kms_permissions.json
  ]
}

# Create a KMS key with the combined policy
resource "aws_kms_key" "combined_policy_key" {
  description = "KMS key for Keycard with additional CloudWatch Logs permissions"
  policy      = data.aws_iam_policy_document.combined_kms_policy.json
}

# Create a zone using the key with combined policy
resource "keycard_zone" "combined_policy_zone" {
  name        = "My Zone with Combined Policy"
  description = "Zone with customer managed KMS key that has additional permissions"

  encryption_key {
    aws {
      arn = aws_kms_key.combined_policy_key.arn
    }
  }
}
```
